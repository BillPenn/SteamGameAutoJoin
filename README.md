# SteamGameAutoJoin

Displays room number on resume button.
Adds an entry field and an "Auto Join" button to the lobby page for the Steam Summer Monster Minigame.
Will try to connect to the specified room and will enter the room when successful (unlike other autojoin spamming scripts).

TODO: Allow for canceling (in first implementation, page refresh is required to reset)
TODO: Add autojoin buttons and room numbers on friends list
TODO: Pull in known room numbers from various sources (steamga.me, MSG15, CMP2015, YOWH, etc)
